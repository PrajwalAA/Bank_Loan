    ### How to Run This Application:
    1.  **Save** the code above as a Python file (e.g., `loan_app.py`).
    2.  **Ensure** you have trained your model and saved it as `bank_loan_model2.pkl`. The provided notebook code saves it as `model.pkl`, so you might need to rename it or adjust `MODEL_PATH` in this Streamlit app to `"model.pkl"`.
    3.  **Place** the `bank_loan_model2.pkl` (or `model.pkl`) file in the **same directory** as `loan_app.py`.
    4.  **Install** the necessary libraries:
        ```bash
        pip install streamlit pandas scikit-learn joblib
        ```
        *(Note: If your model was trained with `lightgbm`, ensure `pip install lightgbm` is also done, although `joblib` handles the loading.)*
    5.  **Run** the app from your terminal:
        ```bash
        streamlit run loan_app.py
        ```
    6.  Your browser will automatically open to the Streamlit app!
